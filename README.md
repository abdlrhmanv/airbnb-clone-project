üí° Importance of User-Friendly Design
A well-designed booking system plays a crucial role in user satisfaction and conversion rates. In platforms like Airbnb, clear navigation , intuitive interfaces , and responsive layouts help reduce friction in the user journey.

By focusing on usability:

Users can easily find and book accommodations.
Cognitive load is minimized, leading to faster decision-making.
Accessibility and inclusivity are prioritized, ensuring a wider audience reach.
Trust is built through professional and consistent visual design.
This project emphasizes user-centered design principles , ensuring that every interaction feels natural and purposeful.

üñåÔ∏è Color Styles
The following color styles were identified from the Figma design to ensure visual consistency across the application:

Primary Color
#34967C
Secondary Color
#FFA800
Background Color
#FFFFFF
Text Color
#222222
Secondary Text
#FFFFFF

These colors help maintain brand identity, readability, and visual hierarchy throughout the app.

üî§ Typography
Typography plays a key role in readability and user experience. The following font settings were used in the Figma mockup:

Primary Text
Quicksand
Medium (600)
22px
Headings
Source Sans Pro
Bold (600)
94px
Secondary Text
Quicksand
Medium (500)
17px

Using a consistent typographic system ensures clarity, professionalism, and better accessibility for all users.

üí° Importance of Identifying Design Properties of a Mockup
Understanding and documenting design properties such as colors , typography , spacing , and layout grids is crucial for several reasons:

Design Consistency:
Ensures that all UI elements across different pages follow the same visual language, making the app feel cohesive and polished.
Smooth Developer Handoff:
Developers rely on accurate design specifications to implement components correctly. Clear documentation reduces misunderstandings and speeds up development.
Team Collaboration:
When working in a team, having defined design properties allows multiple contributors to work simultaneously without breaking the design system.
Scalability & Maintenance:
As the application grows, reusable styles and components make it easier to update and scale the design over time.
Accessibility & Usability:
Proper contrast ratios, readable fonts, and logical spacing improve accessibility and overall user satisfaction.
By analyzing and defining these design properties early in the process, we ensure a more efficient workflow and deliver a high-quality user experience.
